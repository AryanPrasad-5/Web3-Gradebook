# Web3-Gradebook
📘 Gradebook Smart Contract

A simple and beginner-friendly Solidity smart contract that works as an on-chain gradebook. It allows storing and retrieving student grades securely using blockchain technology. Designed with simplicity in mind, this project has no input fields during deployment, making it perfect for learning smart contracts, mappings, and basic state management in Solidity.

📌 Project Description

This project provides a minimal and easy-to-understand Gradebook smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain (or any EVM-compatible chain).
The contract lets any user add or update grades for students using their names as keys.

The purpose of this project is to help beginners understand:

How mappings work in Solidity

How smart contract state is stored

How to build simple, functional dApps

How to deploy and interact with a contract via Remix or Web3 scripts

🎯 What It Does

The Gradebook contract allows users to:

Add a student's grade

Update an existing grade

Retrieve a grade using the student's name

Emit an event whenever a grade is updated

It acts like a simple dictionary or database where:

student name → grade

⭐ Features
✔️ Simple & Beginner-Friendly

No constructor parameters and minimal code structure.

✔️ Grade Storage

Uses a Solidity mapping to store student grades efficiently.

✔️ Update & Retrieve

Grades can be added, updated, or fetched anytime.

✔️ Event Logging

Every update emits a GradeUpdated event for transparency.

✔️ Gas-Friendly

No complex logic; only essential operations are used.
